# About this repo

This repo intend to be a keeper for my note as self-learner, I did learn calculus 1, 2, and 3 along with linear algebra computation based but due to many I think I can not public that and I using Obsidian app to take that note, but for more abstraction side of mathematics I think Typst is better in both format and for myself in higher education.
I did start my abstraction route to Analysis by Terrence Tao but my hand writing back then is mess and my notebook is full of attempation of proving thing because my proof skill is weak (still weak but better).
Right now, I'm learning Linear Algebra done right and Measure, integration, real analysis both book by Sheldon Axler after these I intended to do Probability theory using Shiryaev's both book (supplement with Probability theory by Paolo Baldi).
Also plan to start Complex analysis with Application by Grafakos and Asmar and some point-set topology book to prepare myself to learn Functional analysis in the future.

## Goal and Focus
Right now my focus is on getting into probability theory and stochastic process,
since I want to transition from computer engineer to master degree applied mathematics, and my interested is probability and stochastic process but functional analysis is also catch my interested too.

I learn stuff while doing becherlor degree in computer engineer, so the progress might be slow due to my work but it's my passion too, so I think I will update occasionally.
