# About this repo

This repo is intended to keep my notes as a self-learner. I have completed Calculus I–III, along with a computational linear algebra course. I can’t make those notes public, and I used Obsidian to take them. For more abstract mathematics, however, I think Typst is better—both for formatting and for my future studies.

I started my abstract route with Terence Tao’s Analysis, but my handwriting back then was messy, and my notebook is full of attempts at proofs because my proof skills were weak (still weak, but better now).

Right now, I’m studying Linear Algebra Done Right and Measure, Integration & Real Analysis (both by Sheldon Axler). After these, I plan to study probability theory using Shiryaev’s two-volume series (supplemented by Paolo Baldi’s Probability: An Introduction Through Theory and Exercises).

I also plan to start complex analysis using Complex Analysis with Applications (Grafakos & Asmar) and a point-set topology book, to prepare for learning functional analysis in the future.

# Goal and focus

My current focus is probability theory and stochastic processes. I want to transition from computer engineering to a master’s degree in applied mathematics. My main interests are probability and stochastic processes, but functional analysis also interests me.

I’m learning while completing a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering, so progress may be slow due to coursework, but this is also my passion—so I’ll update this repository occasionally.

# About problems in the books

I try to solve at least half of the problems in each section, given limited time and mental capacity.
